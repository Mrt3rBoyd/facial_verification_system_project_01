# facial_verification_system_project_01

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based face recognition authentication system that combines
user data management with biometric verification. The system allows users to
register and log in using facial recognition through a webcam. It is designed
to improve authentication security using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- User registration system
- Face recognition login using DeepFace
- Webcam integration with timeout control
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Local data storage for privacy
